## tailwindcss-animate

The original `tailwindcss-animate` plugin consists with 2 parts
- Animations 
- Animation property modifiers


Animation property modifiers are already supported by `@unocss/preset-wind` or `@unocss/preset-uno`. Since this preset is based on them, so that part is removed.

Options for configuring default value of animation properties are provided. Please refer to [Preset's Options](/guide/#options).

Animations are way more flexible and powerful. Please refer to [Animations](/animations/).

For detailed migration guide, please refer to [Migrate from `tailwindcss-animate`](./migration#tailwindcss-animate).
